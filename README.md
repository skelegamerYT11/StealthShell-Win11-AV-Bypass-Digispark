StealthShell is an educational project demonstrating how to use a DigiSpark microcontroller to create a reverse shell that can 
bypass antivirus software on Windows 11. This project highlights the potential vulnerabilities in current antivirus solutions 
and aims to raise awareness about the importance of robust security practices.

Features:

Utilizes DigiSpark for compact and stealthy deployment.
Bypasses common antivirus software on Windows 11.
Establishes a reverse shell for remote command execution.

Disclaimer:
This project is intended for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of reverse shells and disabling antivirus software 
is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have proper authorization and use such tools responsibly.

Usage:

1째 Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/skelegamerYT11/StealthShell-Win11-AV-Bypass-Digispark.git
2째 Change the IP and PORT
3째 Upload the script to the DigiSpark microcontroller.
4째 Deploy the DigiSpark on a Windows 11 machine for testing.
